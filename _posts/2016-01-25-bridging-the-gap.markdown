With the technological boom, it is nearly impossible to avoid speculating about artificial intelligence. Films like "Her" and "Ex Machina" have not merely contributed to the popularity of AI, but have also suggested that it is within our grasp to manufacture genuine intelligence. Nevertheless, there seems to be one untraversable gap between actual intelligence and the current prospects our best machines have to offer--namely, what might be called a rational volition. One way to think about a rational volition is an ability to choose or select a solution or course of action *because* (or for the reason that) it is true. Consider two people who both correctly affirm that the solution to a certain math equation is 7. The first person sees that the answer must be 7, because she worked through the equation. The second person, however, simply chose 7 because it was his favorite number, and in this case it also happened to be the correct solution. We wouldn't say that the second person *knew* the solution. This is because the reason he selected 7 had nothing to do with 7 being the true answer to the equation; it was selected simply because it was his favorite number. In every deterministic system there exists a similar dilemma. Any being (machine or person) who selects a solution solely because the antecedent conditions determined one course of action (and no other) cannot be selecting an action *because* it is true. The course of action might be consistent with what is true, but the reason or explanation that such a course of action was selected rather than an alternative, is entirely explicable on the basis of prior conditions / causes, and not on the basis of whether or not a solution is true or reasonable. Consider a line of dominoes. Each domino does exactly what it does only because of the previous domino that struck it (with exception to the first). The actions (or outputs) of the dominos are determined by their circumstances. As it now stands, machines are entirely deterministic; their output is wholly determined by their conditions. When a computer computes the solution to "2 + 2", it does not output "4" because it sees or knows that "4" is the correct or true solution. It does so for one reason and one reason only: it was programmed to provide that output under those circumstances--we could have programmed it to give us another output instead and it would have all been the same to the computer. This is presumably a very different kind of process than what occurs in the mind of a person who outputs "4" to "2 + 2". In the case of the person, "4" is the selected output because one sees that it is true and any other answer would be false. The fact that one sees that four is the correct solution does not act deterministically on the person; that is, a reason does not force a person to act any particular way--perhaps the world would be better if it did. Nevertheless, the difference between a rational process and a deterministic process is what C. S. Lewis succinctly summarized as a chain of reasoning versus a chain of causation. This remains one of the most challenging impediments to manufacturing beings that are genuinely intelligent.
