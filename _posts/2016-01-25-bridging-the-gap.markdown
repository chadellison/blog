With the technological boom, it is nearly impossible to avoid speculating about artificial intelligence. Films like "Her" and "Ex Machina" have not merely contributed to the popularity of AI, but have also suggested that it is within our grasp to manufacture genuine intelligence. Nevertheless, there is an ostensibly untraversable gap between actual intelligence and the current prospects of our best machines--namely, what might be called a rational volition. That is, an ability to choose or select a solution or course of action because (or for the reason) that it is true and reasonable. This is a very different process than selecting a solution solely because the anticedant conditions were sufficient to determine one to select one course of action, and no other. As it now stands, machines are entirely deterministic; their output is wholly determined by their input. Consider a line of dominoes. Each domino does exactly what it does only because of the previous domino that struck it (with exception to the first). The actions (or outputs) of the dominos are determined by their circumstances. Similarly, when a computer computes the solution to "2 + 2", it does not output "4" because it sees or knows that "4" is the correct or true solution. It does so for one reason and one reason only: it was programmed to provide that output according to its inputs--and, we could have programmed it to give us another output instead. This is a very different kind of process that occurs in the mind of a person who outputs "4" to "2 + 2". In the case of the person, "4" is the selected output because one sees that it is true and any other answer would be false. C. S. Lewis succinctly summarized this as the difference between a chain of reasoning and a chain of causation. While remarkable strides toward AI have occurred, this remains one of the most difficult barriers to producing a machine that is actually intelligent.
