Debugging--that process that you dump an exorbitant amount of unanticipated time into. You may have met that cute error message with an innocent bravado, not knowing you would be ready to pull your hair out several hours later. As a novice developer, this experience is no stranger to me and fixing bugs is a job function every developer inherits (if not taken explicitly).

One of the patterns I noticed about all of the best developers around me, however, is that they were all good at debugging. This should be obvious. With the wealth of information available, a person is not a great developer because he or she just happens to possess a lot of knowledge. Rather, a great programmer is a great problem solver; one has a process to quickly and efficiently break a problem down, got to its root, and destroy it. Debugging is a skill, and perhaps even the most valuable skill a programmer can possess. This fact compels me to be a passionate debugger--I don't even think about bugs the way I used to--a hinderance preventing me from doing real work or *building a thing*. Rather, debugging is the vehicle to building something more valuable and more abstract than an app--it is building a programmer into oneself.
