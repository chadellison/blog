Growing up as an artist (the artwork on this blog is my doing) and curious boy,
I found being a philosopher unavoidable. Philosophy just means the love of wisdom--in this sense,
all people are philosophers in as much as they pursue wisdom. My decision to study art
and philosophy formally was driven by an irresistible draw to the big questions, those overarching intuitive principles
that govern our most significant decisions. Some examples include, what we are, why we do what we do, how we know what we know, and what ultimate goal one is working towards. I'm currently pursuing a career in programming and have become fascinated with the nature of intelligence, especially as it relates to computer programming.
